# Rwanda Climate Resilience Dashboard

A static frontend application designed to monitor climate-related data in Rwanda and provide alerts based on anomaly detection. This project is intended for deployment on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Overview

This dashboard provides a visualization of climate data for various districts in Rwanda. It fetches real-time weather information from the Open-Meteo API, compares it against baseline data, and flags anomalies. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

*   **Real-time Data:** Fetches current weather data from Open-Meteo.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Simple detection mechanism to identify significant deviations from baseline climate data.
*   **Data Visualization:** (Future goal) Map-based visualization of districts and climate alerts.
*   **Supabase Integration:** Uses Supabase for data storage and retrieval.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Data Source:** [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
*   **Database:** [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   A Supabase account.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IConfy/Rwanda-Climate-Resilience.git
    ```
2.  **Configure Supabase**
    Open `assets/config.js` and add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key:
    ```javascript
    const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
    const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
    ```

## Database Setup

The project relies on a Supabase backend for data persistence.

### Schema

The following tables are required:

*   `district_baselines`: Stores baseline climate data for each district.
    *   `id` (pk)
    *   `name`
    *   `latitude`
    *   `longitude`
    *   `avg_rainfall`
    *   `avg_temperature`
*   `district_updates`: Logs real-time weather data.
    *   `id` (pk)
    *   `district_id` (fk to `district_baselines`)
    *   `timestamp`
    *   `rainfall`
    *   `temperature`
    *   `humidity`
    *   `windspeed`
*   `district_alerts`: Stores alerts generated by the anomaly detection system.
    *   `id` (pk)
    *   `district_id` (fk to `district_baselines`)
    *   `timestamp`
    *   `severity`
    *   `details`

**Note:** The Supabase setup and schema are currently under development and are not yet stable. The provided SQL schema in the `db` directory is for testing purposes.

## Future Work

*   **Authentication:** Implement secure data insertion and user management.
*   **Advanced Anomaly Detection:** Enhance the detection logic (e.g., drought indices, rolling windows).
*   **Server-Side Processing:** Move the data polling and anomaly detection to a server-side worker (e.g., Supabase Edge Function or GitHub Action) for better reliability.
*   **Notifications:** Integrate notification services (e.g., Twilio, WhatsApp API, SendGrid) to push alerts.
